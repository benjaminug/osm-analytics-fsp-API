About OSM-Analytics FSP
--------

The real-time financial service location planning and search System is composed of a web application that aims to support financial service providers in gathering information, and thus enabling more informed decision making, on matters such as network planning for mobile money agents, network/branch expansion for agency banking, and to provide (additional) information on risks for loans.

We therefore think that it will be a good idea to provide some guiding questions for the usersâ€™ that will be interacting with this web application as a way of enabling them to quickly familiarise themselves with how the web application works. The guiding questions will help the users apply the right filters.
